# Video Game Sales and Ratings
This project involved the challenging task of merging two distinct datasets from Kaggle: Video Game Sales and Video Game Ratings. The primary goal was to create a unified dataset that could be effectively used for model development, focusing on the intricacies of data integration.

# Objectives and Learning Outcomes
The project's core objective was to develop and refine skills in data integration. The key steps in my process included:

* Standardizing column names across both datasets for consistency.
* Reformating data types to ensure compatibility.
* Transforming features for better alignment and integration.
* Merging the datasets to combine sales data, metascores, and platform information into a singular, comprehensive dataset.

This process was instrumental in understanding the complexities and nuances of combining datasets with varying structures and contents.
# Reflections and Future Improvements
In retrospect, selecting datasets with more inherent similarities could have streamlined the integration process. For future projects, considerations for improvement could include:

* Conducting a more thorough preliminary analysis to identify datasets with more commonalities or easily alignable structures.
* Exploring advanced data matching and merging techniques, such as using machine learning algorithms for automated feature matching.
* Implementing robust data cleaning and preprocessing steps to address discrepancies and inconsistencies before merging.
* Experimenting with different integration approaches, such as database-style joins or concatenations, to find the most effective method for different types of datasets.

These strategies could significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of dataset integration in future projects.
