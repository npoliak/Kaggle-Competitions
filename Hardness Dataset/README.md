# Regression with a Mohs Hardness Dataset
This project focuses on a regression task using the Mohs Hardness Dataset available on Kaggle. This was my first venture into regression analysis, this project was particularly geared towards enhancing my skills in feature engineering and data preprocessing.

# Objectives and Learning Outcomes
The primary objective was to develop proficiency in data preprocessing techniques, moving beyond mere brute force approaches. Key steps in my methodology included:

* Elimination of features with a correlation coefficient less than 0.2 to the target variable.
* Creation of polynomial features to introduce greater linearity.
* Development of new features by combining multiple existing features.
* Application of a simple Linear Regression model for predictions

The main focus of this project was on refining my data preprocessing skills and exploring innovative methods for model creation without over-relying on hyperparameter optimization.

# Reflections and Future Improvements
Looking back, I realize the importance of balancing advanced data preprocessing with effective model optimization. Future projects could benefit from integrating these two skill sets more cohesively. This could involve: 
* Employing advanced feature selection techniques to identify the most impactful variables.
* Exploring different regression models and ensemble methods to improve predictive performance.
* Implementing cross-validation techniques to ensure model stability and generalizability.
* Experimenting with regularization methods to prevent overfitting and enhance model robustness.
These improvements could lead to more sophisticated models that not only leverage clean, well-processed data but also exhibit high efficiency and accuracy in predictions.
