# Kaggle-Competitions

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of the various Kaggle competitions that I participated in as part of my coursework for the Advanced Machine Learning class at Ransom Everglades during the academic year 2023-24. It includes detailed Jupyter notebooks, datasets, models, and analysis for each competition, showcasing the techniques and approaches I employed in machine learning. These resources reflect my journey and growth in understanding complex algorithms, data preprocessing, model optimization, and evaluation metrics.
