# Binary Classification with a Tabular Kidney Stone Prediction Dataset

This project involved participating in the "Binary Classification with a Tabular Kidney Stone Prediction Dataset" competition on Kaggle. The primary aim was to demonstrate my proficiency in building an effective classification model, in collaboration with a partner. Our approach included an initial exploration of the dataset, strategizing on model development, and finally evaluating and submitting our model.

# Objectives and Learning Outcomes

The project began with an in-depth analysis of the dataset, particularly focusing on its medical test features. Utilizing our domain knowledge, we engineered new features that showed a higher correlation with the target variable. Our methodology included:

* Feature Engineering based on medical test interpretations
* Data Scaling for normalization
* Implementation of a basic Gradient Boosting Classifier
* Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
* Experiments with Support Vector Machine (SVM) & XGBoost (XGB) models
* Development of a stacked model combining Gradient Boosting, SVM, and XGB

This approach culminated in our final model submission.

# Reflections and Future Improvements
In retrospect, dedicating more time to data cleaning and feature selection could have further enhanced model performance. Future improvements might include employing advanced techniques like feature selection algorithms to identify the most predictive variables, cross-validation to ensure model robustness, and exploring alternative ensemble methods for potentially better predictive accuracy.
