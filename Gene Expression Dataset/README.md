# Gene Expression Dataset

This project is a detailed exploration of the Gene Expression Dataset available on Kaggle, undertaken as a key component of my final 1st semester project in my class. My primary focus was on applying PCA analysis to handle massive multidimensional data effectively. This project reflects my efforts to thoroughly analyze the dataset and develop an efficient model.

# Objectives and Learning Outcomes
The main objective was to gain hands-on experience in managing and interpreting large-scale genetic data. Key techniques and methods I employed include:

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbor)
* Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
* Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Stratified K-Fold for cross-validation
* Data Transposition
* Undersampling
* Utilization of dynamic programming and functions for enhanced efficiency and algorithm testing

The focus was primarily on data processing and identifying genes that significantly contributed to the differences observed between ALL and AML samples in the dataset.

# Reflections and Future Improvement
After testing various models, both with and without hyperparameter tuning, Logistic Regression emerged as the model with the highest performance score. Upon reflection, I recognize that the dataset's limited size might impact its effectiveness with out-of-sample data. In future projects, employing a larger dataset for training could be beneficial to avoid overfitting and improve model generalizability.
