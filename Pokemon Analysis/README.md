# Pokemon Data Analysis

This project entailed a comprehensive data analysis of a Pokemon dataset, which included details such as names, ranks, generations, evolutions, typings, base stats, height, and abilities. With growing ambition in my data analysis projects, this endeavor aimed at extracting insightful trends and patterns from the rich and diverse data of the Pokemon universe.

# Objectives and Learning Outcomes
The project began with a focus on several key analytical tasks:

* Comparing Pokemon Body Mass Indexes (BMIs) by transforming data types to more accessible formats like integers.
* Creating a correlation matrix to identify initial relationships between various data attributes.
* Developing radar charts for each Pokemon type to analyze overall stats distribution, noting trends like the high attack of Dragon types versus the balanced stats of Water types.
* Mapping out Pokemon type weaknesses and effectiveness.
* Designing an algorithm to simulate battles between all possible Pokemon pairs, determining winners based on stats and type matchups. This led to the creation of a new dataset predicting outcomes of these theoretical battles.
* Training a model to predict battle outcomes between any two Pokemon, analyzing type-based win probabilities and identifying the most successful type combinations.
* Graphing total stat changes across generations, including specific stat evolutions like HP from one generation to the next.
* Examining the average stat differences due to evolution, both immediate and final stages.

# Reflections and Future Improvements
This project pushed the boundaries of my data analysis skills, particularly in the areas of statistical correlation, predictive modeling, and complex data visualization. For future projects, I aim to:

* Further refine my predictive modeling techniques to enhance accuracy and reliability.
* Explore more advanced data visualization tools to better represent complex relationships and trends in data.
* Dive deeper into statistical analysis to uncover more nuanced insights and patterns.
* Experiment with machine learning algorithms to automate and improve the predictive accuracy of battle outcomes and type effectiveness.

These advancements will not only enhance my understanding of data analysis but also contribute to more sophisticated and insightful explorations in future projects.
