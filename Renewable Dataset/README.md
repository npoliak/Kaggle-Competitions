# Renewable Energy Competition

This project was part of an internal competition in our class, where the challenge was to devise five unique questions for peers to answer using a provided dataset. The questions were designed to test our budding skills in data analysis and encourage exploration of interesting dataset interactions. Examples of these questions include calculating the average population density within specific latitude and longitude ranges, or assessing the per capita energy consumption from non-nuclear sources.

# Objectives and Learning Outcomes
The main aim was to apply our introductory knowledge of data analysis to create engaging and thought-provoking questions. My approach involved:

* Analyzing various aspects of the dataset to formulate challenging yet solvable questions.
* Exploring interactions between different data units and values, such as geographical coordinates, energy consumption, and population metrics.
* Encouraging practical application of data analysis techniques among classmates.

As a beginner in data analysis, this project provided me with an opportunity to experiment with different data aspects and understand their interrelationships.

# Reflections and Future Improvements
Looking back, I recognize that my initial approach was somewhat constrained by my limited experience. For future projects, I plan to:

* Dive deeper into advanced data analysis techniques to uncover more intricate dataset patterns and relationships.
* Explore the use of statistical methods to create more complex and insightful questions.
* Incorporate data visualization tools to aid in the analysis and presentation of findings.
* Engage in collaborative brainstorming sessions to expand the range and creativity of the questions formulated.

These improvements will not only enhance my data analysis skills but also contribute to more dynamic and enriching class competitions.
