# Spaceship Titanic Classification: Kaggle Competition

This project entails a classification challenge from the Spaceship Titanic competition on Kaggle. My primary goal was to develop a highly accurate model, placing a greater emphasis on precision over efficiency and computational time. This approach led to a commendable achievement, placing me within the top 50 competitors.

# Objectives and Learning Outcomes
The central strategy for this competition involved constructing a robust pipeline to effectively utilize features that significantly impacted the outcome. The pipeline consisted of three primary components:
* A branch for numerical imputation.
* A branch for categorical imputation and one-hot encoding.
* A branch dedicated to processing cabin information.

Initially, I employed a Random Forest Classifier, but eventually, I shifted to an ensemble approach. This ensemble combined the strengths of LGBMClassifier, XGBoost, and SVM through majority voting, which significantly improved the model's accuracy.

# Reflections and Future Improvements
In hindsight, a more focused effort on feature analysis could have enhanced the model's efficiency. Since this project was completed before I fully developed my skills in data preprocessing, several opportunities for improvement were overlooked. For future projects, I would consider:

* Implementing more rigorous feature selection and importance analysis to identify and focus on the most impactful variables.
* Balancing the trade-off between model complexity and efficiency to ensure faster execution without significant loss of accuracy.
* Experimenting with different ensemble techniques and hyperparameter tuning to further refine the model's performance.
* Exploring more advanced data preprocessing techniques to enhance the model's ability to generalize and handle diverse datasets.

These strategies could lead to a more balanced approach, combining high accuracy with efficient data processing and model execution.
